<p> Hey everyone ! Welcome to my Blog :-) ! I named it meep chronicles but my real name is Francesca.
    I am really excited to show everyone my interests and share my thoughts. I think blogging can
    be an effective way to communicate your opinions to the one's around you. It is also a great way
    to journal/log your life, and see how far you have come from when you first started. I am really 
    excited to see how my life progresses over the next few months of this course, and I can't wait to 
    look back on all my blogs. I think blogging can be very helpful when it comes to one's professional 
    life as well. It can be the perfect place to keep people updated on what your goals are, and what
    you have done to work towards accomplishing them. For example, I am studying to be a mechanical 
    engineer, and I love building different contraptions or working on different crafts. I have been 
    building a robotic bug for a bit now, and my blog would be an ideal place to showcase my progress 
    on it. It would also be fun to display the other projects I am working on. Currently I am also 
    making a lamp shade, and a new necklace for myself. I would love to show you guys them soon !
    I also want to use this space to share some of the art work I admire, and the photos I find pretty or 
    interesting. I want to show people my design aesthetics and personal style.
    </p>
