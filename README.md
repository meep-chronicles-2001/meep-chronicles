<p> Hey everyone ! Welcome to my Blog :-) ! I named it meep chronicles but my real name is Francesca.
    I am really excited to show everyone my interests and share my thoughts. I think blogging can
    be an effective way to communicate your opinions to the one's around you. It is also a great way
    to journal/log your life, and see how far you have come from when you first started. I am really 
    excited to see how my life progresses over the next few months of this course, and I can't wait to 
    look back on all my blogs. I think blogging can be very helpful when it comes to one's professional 
    life as well. It can be the perfect place to keep people updated on what your goals are, and what
    you have done to work towards accomplishing them. For example, I am studying to be a mechanical 
    engineer, and I love building different contraptions or working on different crafts. I have been 
    building a robotic bug for a bit now, and my blog would be an ideal place to showcase my progress 
    on it. It would also be fun to display the other projects I am working on. Currently I am also 
    making a lamp shade, and a new necklace for myself. I would love to show you guys them soon !
    I also want to use this space to share some of the art work I admire, and the photos I find pretty or 
    interesting. I want to show people my design aesthetics and personal style.

    <b><h3> 09-17-23;SUNDAY;9:18pm;Post-storyboard Analysis</b></h3>
    Hello all, and welcome back to my page Meep Chronicles. I am just beginning to reflect on the storyboard
    I created and turned in. I decided to write my story on a girl who learned how to make her father's bread
    after many years of eating it. It was a nostalgic story for me because it makes me think of my own dad, 
    and the food he has cooked for me throughout my childhood. I am chilean, so there are many dishes that make
    me feel comforted, and remind me of my own family. Since I moved out when I was 16, I yearn for these meals, 
    and wanted to write a story that highlights the importance of them. These meals are more than just delicious,
    they represent me as a person, my childhood, and the cultures that shaped me. One of my all time favorites of 
    my dad's is his Cazuela, a chilean soup dish. It has an amazing beef broth base, cooked down with 
    slow cooked short ribs, celery, squash, potatoes, bell peppers, rice, green beans, and corn. It is served with
    sides of different salads, pebre-a chilean salsa, and pan amasado, which is the bread I reference in my storyboard. 
    I grew up with a father that really valued good, homemade meals, and it has shown me how to truly appreciate
    the food from my chilean culture. I can not wait to continue to learn how to cook the meals my dad has cooked for me 
    my entire life, and eventually be able to share it with my own kids, and teach them about our chilean culture. 
    Not being able to grow up in Chile, I felt that food was the closest connection I had to that side of me, and I will
    continue to use it as a way to feel close with my dad.

<b><h3> 09-24-23;SUNDAY;4:08pm; Reflection on Digital Storytelling </b></h3>    
https://media0.giphy.com/media/CnLRoQneO2kWHuRg7g/giphy.gif

Greetings all ! Another week has flown by, and I can't seem to remember where the time went. I have had a lot of midterms 
the last two weeks, and I am preparing for two that I will be taking on wednesday. I am feeling good about them at the
moment, so I am hoping for good results. As I think back on the week, one of my highlights was finalizing my story. I had
a really great time animating the story, and used stop motion to create it all. If I had more time I think I would have 
redone the drawings in a different style, which I started but didn't have enough time to finish for the project turn in.
I learned a lot about what it take to create a quality video, that is also entertaining and direct for audiences. I really
utilized my storyboard as the basis of my video creation, and had to redraw each scene with small changes to make the 
video appear to have moving objects, rather than it all being still. I wanted it to have a lot of colors to make it 
more stimulating for viewers. I decided to talk about how I learned to bake my fathers bread pan amasado. I am really
excited to hear your guys' feedback. It was a lot more meticulous than I was expecting and it took me a long time
to properly cut and compile all of the scenes. I will attach a link to the video below. If anyone has any suggestions for 
how I can clean up my work I would love to hear ! It has teachen me how to communicate a story through the internet to 
others ! If I finish my other version I will insert in here as well :-)

<b><h3> Sunday, 11:16pm: week 6</b></h3>

Hey everyone ! Hope everything has been going well, I’ve been having midterms the last two weeks so i've been busy busy busy ! This week in digital technology we learned about the term community of practice, and watched a few Ted talks about how it relates to social media ! I loved the idea of voluntary participation, it really allows for genuine and authentic interaction and engagement. Social media, or even blogging, allows people to express their opinions and beliefs, and help like minded individuals find one another through their algorithms and search engines. I decided to download and sign up for twitter and pinterest, both of which will allow me to find communities or online groups that share things of interest to me, or help me explore new ideas and concepts. Another one that really allows people to form communities is Reddit. It revolves around different communities where people agree to follow certain community guidelines in order to share ideas, pictures, ideas, questions, discussion prompts, etc ! I’m excited to cultivate my own boards on Pinterest and find new creative crafts or ideas for art projects. I’m in the midst of building and designing my own lampshade, so I’ll have to put some photos of the process on here and show you guys any inspiration I got from stuff I found on Pinterest. 
I’m also really excited to be able to follow some of my friends on twitter and get to figure out how to use it. It’s gonna be interesting to write and share my first tweet….! I’m hoping to find some new communities through hashtags :-)

<b><h3> Sunday, 9:07pm: week 7</b></h3>
Hey everyone ! I’m back on a Sunday night once again to check in about what I learned this week ! We covered digital literacy and its importance in the modern age. When there is so much misinformation and media bias, it can be very easy for people to start consuming the wrong media sources. When consuming misinformation without knowing, the world we live in becomes a narrowed and controlled place where we are being fed a reality created by others to fulfill certain motives. It can be a dangerous and scary place on the internet, so it’s important to have the proper tools to navigate it in a safe and educated manner. Being able to use the google search filters can be really helpful for finding verified websites like .orgs or research papers. I’ve also found that knowing how to do a quick fact check yourself when opening a site can go a long way. By being able to glance at the different credentials on a website and know if they are trustworthy sources, you will be able to spot any red flags efficiently. I have also found a few online sources that will walk you through the fact checking process. I think it’s also important for people to understand that people often have a motive or bias when they put articles or information into the online world, and that can influence their take or view on a situation and skew it in their favor. Not everyone can be trusted to put out objective information, so by knowing this you can be more aware of what you’re consuming and why. I think it’s a really important tool to have at an early age, since you are easily influenced when you are young, and can be taught things that are inaccurate and damaging. 

<b><h3> Saturday, 11:01pm: 10-21-23 </b></h3>
Hello everyone ! It’s Francesca here again.. And the weeks are moving by so quickly !! I really can't believe it is over half way through the school semester ! I am writing to you on a saturday night, because sunday is going to be extra busy for me so I thought I’d get ahead on my work. This week we focused on creativity, copyright, and fair use, and how important it is to give proper credit to other people’s internet property. I think it is very important, and explains a lot of the reasoning behind why certain youtube videos, or sounds that overlay people’s reels get taken down. If you use too much of someone’s work without buying, or legally getting permission to do so, it is like stealing ! I know that everyone gets taught how to cite work they are using for a paper, and are educated on the concepts of plagiarism, but this is one of the first times I have officially been taught about copyright. Another topic we learned about this week was website evaluation ! I remember when I was first taught this in middle school, although it was not as in-depth. The internet is a big world, and it is crucial for people to know how to evaluate the information they are consuming to know if it is reliable or not. For the website evaluation assignment we had to pick a website we would provide to students if we were their teacher. I decided that I would provide them with weekly videos from the website khan academy, that would act as a tutoring tool for before they start their homework. I know a lot of kids do not have the time or energy to start homework when they get back from school, so the lecture material won’t be as fresh in their mind. I think it would be really helpful for them if I, as their teacher, picked out videos that help refresh their memory on that week’s topic, and the problem solving strategies that go with it. 

<b><h3> Thursday, 10-24pm: 10-26-23 </b></h3>
It is me again ! This time I am extra early, writing to you on a Thursday ! I have midterms next wednesday, and this weekend is going to be packed full of studying, so I am trying to get ahead of my other classes so I can focus on preparing for exams this weekend. This week was a fun one ! We got to explore 5 different 2.0 websites that we are familiar with. I chose to talk about linked in, twitter, instagram, snapchat, and my all time favorite, reddit ! Reddit is seriously a cool site, and if you guys haven’t checked it out yet, you should ! It is a site that has tons of different communities you can join and interact with. By joining a community that is of interest to you, you can learn about new ideas or concepts within that world, and hear other people's thoughts or ideas. Out of all social media platforms, it is one of the safest, and most welcoming spaces in the online world. Part of the reason for that, I believe, is because of their community guidelines feature, where people are required to agree to abide by the rules if they want to join the community. Usually these guidelines require no hateful speech, no bullying or harassment, etc. This provides people with a safe space to share their opinions or ideas without any fear of online bullying or hate for it. They also have an upvote feature, so the posts with the most upvotes will be at the top of the forum. People can go to a community and ask for advice, or start a debate or conversation they might not be able to have with other people in their lives. If I had it my way, I would make sure that every social media site had these requirements. It would be a much nicer place in the online world if people weren’t allowed to be rude to one another. 


<b><h3> Sunday 3:29pm: 11-05-23 </b></h3>
Hey everyone ! I am back, and happy to do another update for this week ! This week in class we focused on assistive technologies and its role in today’s world. I think it is crucial that all products are designed to be accessible and usable by all people. There are many people in this world with a variety of different limitations, and it is important to take these limitations into account. After reading the articles, and watching the videos from this week I walked away with a greater awareness of the apps that are out there to help increase the quality of life for people that may struggle with certain day to day tasks. One of the free apps I came across was called “fuelService” which created a line of communication for users and the gas station workers. This line of communication allows people with physical limitations to contact workers to request assistance once arriving at the station, and also shows which stations in the area can offer that support. It asks users to input certain information, like the desired gas type. Once users arrive at the station, there are buttons that they can press to send a pre-automated message to notify workers of their arrival ! I think it is important that we are all made aware of these apps, and continue to work towards a world that is designed to be fully accessible to all people, not just neurotypical, and able-bodied individuals. We can do our part by supporting brands and companies that create products that can be used by all people, or have the ability to be modified both easily and inexpensively to be used by people with mental or physical limitations. It is important that we continue to move forward and grow into a society that is accessible for everyone, rather than just one demographic.

<b><h3> Sunday, 9:13pm: 11-12-23 </b></h3>
Hello again, here I am at the end of the 12th week of the school year ! Only a little over a month left and we are all going on break ! I’m really excited to have some time to myself that I can dedicate solely to work and hobbies. This week in digital technology we designed an accessibility app that would help all people, abled and disabled, contact emergency services in a quick and easy manner. I know how overwhelming it can be to navigate your phone during an emergency, and it must be immensely more difficult if you have any physical or mental limitations. My app has one single screen, rather than multiple, with all buttons needed in one single place. I made sure to include an emergency contacts button, which will forward your location and emergency notification to 911 and your emergency contacts. I also made sure to have a voice enabler that can be enabled with a push of a button or an audio command. This will allow people to navigate through the app, and the buttons easily with voice commands. I also added a feature that always displays your location, time, and date, so when you are contacting emergency services, it is always updated and ready to recite. I think these apps should be more popular, since safety is such a concern these days. It’s important for people our age to be thinking about simple innovations such as this app to help make dangerous situations less dangerous. I think I probably got this idea from the necklace for elders that allow them to click a button for emergency services, but I have never seen it made for people that have to rely on voice command, nor have I seen it provided in a phone platform.

<b><h3> Sunday, 9:38pm: 11-19-23 </b></h3>
Hey all choosing to visit meep chronicles ! It is a pleasure having you here again on a sunday night. This week in digital technology we learned about the advancements in technology and our predictions for what will be coming in the future. Currently, the newest and hottest topic in 2023 is the advancements in AI (Artificial intelligence). AI and the creation of platforms like ChatGPT has allowed information to become more accessible for everyone. One of the articles we read this week discussed how education would develop in the coming years to utilize artificial technology. One of the predictions was that AI would help create a more versatile learning environment for students with different learning styles. I think this could help children become more confident in themselves, their intelligence, and their strengths. I am excited to see the progression of technology in the classroom. Another thing we had to do this week was list some of the advancements that have yet to come, like flying cars. I feel like when I was a kid, a lot of the cartoons and movies I watched had flying cars and robots everywhere so that’s what I grew up expecting to see by this age. I know there are many companies in and around the bay area making large advancements in flying, autonomous cars, but they are yet to be released for public use. I know there are also a lot of regulations and safety requirements that have to be made and fulfilled before they are used as well, since this is completely new territory. I am interested to see how long it will take them to start test driving them around the city, since they already have so many self-driving cars running around everywhere here already, and no one here is a fan of those….

<b><h3> Sunday, 11:25pm: 12-3-23 </b></h3>
Hello everyone ! I’m back from break and here writing to you for one of the last times this semester. This week we used the time to catch up on old work, but I have kept up to date with everything this semester so I just got to relax from this class. I spent my free time working on my craft projects. I am currently in the process of making a doll. It is a bit frustrating making tiny clothes and I honestly don’t know if I will ever do it again. After I finish with this project I am going to finish the soldering process of my lampshade project. I am getting excited for the actual shade design process, and choosing the colors and beading pattern. I want the color palette to be red, purple, and burnt orange…I will have to come back later and post some updates. I don’t think I will stop blogging after this…it’s just going to become a place to display all my art projects I think. Maybe I will post photos of my halloween costume/jewelry design because that was pretty fun. I wonder what project I will start next. I think it’d be a lot easier to make the doll if I had a sewing machine but I don’t. It works out I just get pretty sloppy with it….kind of suits what I was going for. I enjoyed sculpting the head the most… should’ve gotten the eyes before baking it. Now I know,,, but I will never do this again so I don’t know for next time. I would love to take another ceramics class but my schedules are so full next semester and the class is full too. I wonder if I can use the facilities on certain days if I’m not a student. I’ll have to look into it.
