<p> Hey everyone ! Welcome to my Blog :-) ! I named it meep chronicles but my real name is Francesca.
    I am really excited to show everyone my interests and share my thoughts. I think blogging can
    be an effective way to communicate your opinions to the one's around you. It is also a great way
    to journal/log your life, and see how far you have come from when you first started. I am really 
    excited to see how my life progresses over the next few months of this course, and I can't wait to 
    look back on all my blogs. I think blogging can be very helpful when it comes to one's professional 
    life as well. It can be the perfect place to keep people updated on what your goals are, and what
    you have done to work towards accomplishing them. For example, I am studying to be a mechanical 
    engineer, and I love building different contraptions or working on different crafts. I have been 
    building a robotic bug for a bit now, and my blog would be an ideal place to showcase my progress 
    on it. It would also be fun to display the other projects I am working on. Currently I am also 
    making a lamp shade, and a new necklace for myself. I would love to show you guys them soon !
    I also want to use this space to share some of the art work I admire, and the photos I find pretty or 
    interesting. I want to show people my design aesthetics and personal style.

    <b><h3> 09-17-23;SUNDAY;9:18pm;Post-storyboard Analysis</b></h3>
    Hello all, and welcome back to my page Meep Chronicles. I am just beginning to reflect on the storyboard
    I created and turned in. I decided to write my story on a girl who learned how to make her father's bread
    after many years of eating it. It was a nostalgic story for me because it makes me think of my own dad, 
    and the food he has cooked for me throughout my childhood. I am chilean, so there are many dishes that make
    me feel comforted, and remind me of my own family. Since I moved out when I was 16, I yearn for these meals, 
    and wanted to write a story that highlights the importance of them. These meals are more than just delicious,
    they represent me as a person, my childhood, and the cultures that shaped me. One of my all time favorites of 
    my dad's is his Cazuela, a chilean soup dish. It has an amazing beef broth base, cooked down with 
    slow cooked short ribs, celery, squash, potatoes, bell peppers, rice, green beans, and corn. It is served with
    sides of different salads, pebre-a chilean salsa, and pan amasado, which is the bread I reference in my storyboard. 
    I grew up with a father that really valued good, homemade meals, and it has shown me how to truly appreciate
    the food from my chilean culture. I can not wait to continue to learn how to cook the meals my dad has cooked for me 
    my entire life, and eventually be able to share it with my own kids, and teach them about our chilean culture. 
    Not being able to grow up in Chile, I felt that food was the closest connection I had to that side of me, and I will
    continue to use it as a way to feel close with my dad.
