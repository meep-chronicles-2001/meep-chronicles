<p> Hey everyone ! Welcome to my Blog :-) ! I named it meep chronicles but my real name is Francesca.
    I am really excited to show everyone my interests and share my thoughts. I think blogging can
    be an effective way to communicate your opinions to the one's around you. It is also a great way
    to journal/log your life, and see how far you have come from when you first started. I am really 
    excited to see how my life progresses over the next few months of this course, and I can't wait to 
    look back on all my blogs. I think blogging can be very helpful when it comes to one's professional 
    life as well. It can be the perfect place to keep people updated on what your goals are, and what
    you have done to work towards accomplishing them. For example, I am studying to be a mechanical 
    engineer, and I love building different contraptions or working on different crafts. I have been 
    building a robotic bug for a bit now, and my blog would be an ideal place to showcase my progress 
    on it. It would also be fun to display the other projects I am working on. Currently I am also 
    making a lamp shade, and a new necklace for myself. I would love to show you guys them soon !
    I also want to use this space to share some of the art work I admire, and the photos I find pretty or 
    interesting. I want to show people my design aesthetics and personal style.

    <b><h3> 09-17-23;SUNDAY;9:18pm;Post-storyboard Analysis</b></h3>
    Hello all, and welcome back to my page Meep Chronicles. I am just beginning to reflect on the storyboard
    I created and turned in. I decided to write my story on a girl who learned how to make her father's bread
    after many years of eating it. It was a nostalgic story for me because it makes me think of my own dad, 
    and the food he has cooked for me throughout my childhood. I am chilean, so there are many dishes that make
    me feel comforted, and remind me of my own family. Since I moved out when I was 16, I yearn for these meals, 
    and wanted to write a story that highlights the importance of them. These meals are more than just delicious,
    they represent me as a person, my childhood, and the cultures that shaped me. One of my all time favorites of 
    my dad's is his Cazuela, a chilean soup dish. It has an amazing beef broth base, cooked down with 
    slow cooked short ribs, celery, squash, potatoes, bell peppers, rice, green beans, and corn. It is served with
    sides of different salads, pebre-a chilean salsa, and pan amasado, which is the bread I reference in my storyboard. 
    I grew up with a father that really valued good, homemade meals, and it has shown me how to truly appreciate
    the food from my chilean culture. I can not wait to continue to learn how to cook the meals my dad has cooked for me 
    my entire life, and eventually be able to share it with my own kids, and teach them about our chilean culture. 
    Not being able to grow up in Chile, I felt that food was the closest connection I had to that side of me, and I will
    continue to use it as a way to feel close with my dad.

Greetings all ! Another week has flown by, and I can't seem to remember where the time went. I have had a lot of midterms 
the last two weeks, and I am preparing for two that I will be taking on wednesday. I am feeling good about them at the
moment, so I am hoping for good results. As I think back on the week, one of my highlights was finalizing my story. I had
a really great time animating the story, and used stop motion to create it all. If I had more time I think I would have 
redone the drawings in a different style, which I started but didn't have enough time to finish for the project turn in.
I learned a lot about what it take to create a quality video, that is also entertaining and direct for audiences. I really
utilized my storyboard as the basis of my video creation, and had to redraw each scene with small changes to make the 
video appear to have moving objects, rather than it all being still. I wanted it to have a lot of colors to make it 
more stimulating for viewers. I decided to talk about how I learned to bake my fathers bread pan amasado. I am really
excited to hear your guys' feedback. It was a lot more meticulous than I was expecting and it took me a long time
to properly cut and compile all of the scenes. I will attach a link to the video below. If anyone has any suggestions for 
how I can clean up my work I would love to hear ! It has teachen me how to communicate a story through the internet to 
others ! If I finish my other version I will insert in here as well :-)


<b><h3> Sunday, 11:16pm: week 6</b></h3>

Hey everyone ! Hope everything has been going well, I’ve been having midterms the last two weeks so i've been busy busy busy ! This week in digital technology we learned about the term community of practice, and watched a few Ted talks about how it relates to social media ! I loved the idea of voluntary participation, it really allows for genuine and authentic interaction and engagement. Social media, or even blogging, allows people to express their opinions and beliefs, and help like minded individuals find one another through their algorithms and search engines. I decided to download and sign up for twitter and pinterest, both of which will allow me to find communities or online groups that share things of interest to me, or help me explore new ideas and concepts. Another one that really allows people to form communities is Reddit. It revolves around different communities where people agree to follow certain community guidelines in order to share ideas, pictures, ideas, questions, discussion prompts, etc ! I’m excited to cultivate my own boards on Pinterest and find new creative crafts or ideas for art projects. I’m in the midst of building and designing my own lampshade, so I’ll have to put some photos of the process on here and show you guys any inspiration I got from stuff I found on Pinterest. 
I’m also really excited to be able to follow some of my friends on twitter and get to figure out how to use it. It’s gonna be interesting to write and share my first tweet….! I’m hoping to find some new communities through hashtags :-)
